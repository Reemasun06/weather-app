DESCRIPTION : The Real-Time Weather Information System is a Python-based web application developed using Streamlit, Requests, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
The main goal of this project is to provide users with live weather data for any city by using the Open-Meteo Public Weather API.

The application takes a city name as input, converts it into geographical coordinates using a Geocoding API, and then fetches the current weather conditions along with hourly temperature forecasts.
